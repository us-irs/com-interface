``com-interface`` - Generic communication abstraction to send arbitrary byte packets
====================================================================================

This library contains a generic communication abstraction specifically targeted
towards the exchange of binary data like CCSDS packets.

The core of this abstraction is the :py:class:`com_interface.ComInterface` class.
An implementation of this class can be passed to other library components and makes
the commanding logic independent of the used interface. It is also possible to
use this abstraction independenctly of the other library components and implement
custom interfaces.

The use of a communication abstraction allows to use the same TMTC specification
independently of the used communication interface. For example, it might be possible to build
an on-board software both for a remote MCU and for a hosted system. The MCU might expect the
same command data to be exchanged via a specific transport layer, while the hosted version
might just use a UDP socket.

The following example shows how to use the :py:class:`com_interface.udp.UdpClient` to send
PUS packets (a subtype of CCSDS space packets) to a UDP server

.. testcode:: udp_com

    import socket

    from com_interface import ComInterface
    from com_interface.udp import UdpClient
    from com_interface.ip_utils import EthAddr
    from spacepackets.ecss.tc import PusTelecommand

    def send_my_telecommand(tc: PusTelecommand, com_if: ComInterface):
    	com_if.send(tc.pack())

    simulated_udp_server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    # Let the OS assign an appropriate port.
    addr = ("127.0.0.1", 0)
    simulated_udp_server.bind(addr)
    addr = simulated_udp_server.getsockname()

    udp_client = UdpClient("udp", send_address=EthAddr.from_tuple(addr))
    udp_client.initialize()
    udp_client.open()

    ping_tc = PusTelecommand(service=17, subservice=1, apid=0x020)
    send_my_telecommand(ping_tc, udp_client)

    recvd_data, sender_addr = simulated_udp_server.recvfrom(4096)
    recvd_tc = PusTelecommand.unpack(recvd_data)

    print(f"Sent TC: {ping_tc}")
    print(f"Received TC: {recvd_tc}")
    udp_client.close()

Output:

.. testoutput:: udp_com

    Sent TC: PUS TC[17, 1] with Request ID 0x1820c000, APID 0x020, SSC 0
    Received TC: PUS TC[17, 1] with Request ID 0x1820c000, APID 0x020, SSC 0

It should be noted that the :py:class:`com_interface.ComInterface.receive` function should never block
and returns a list of received packets. For many concrete implementations, this means that a
separate receiver thread is required to poll for packets periodically and fill them into a packet
list, which is then returned on the receive call.

The receiver thread may then also implement the logic required for some transport layers using
blocking API. For example, the serial COBS interface will perform a blocking
:py:meth:`serial.Serial.read` to look for the start marker 0, and then read until the end marker
0 has been read.

Here is another example where a the same packet is sent via a serial interface. This
example only runs of Unix systems because it simulates a serial port using
`pty <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pty.html>`_.

.. testcode:: serial_cobs
    :skipif: sys.platform.startswith("win")

    import os
    import pty
    import time
    from cobs import cobs

    from com_interface import ComInterface
    from com_interface.serial_cobs import SerialCfg, SerialCobsComIF

    sim_ser_device, pty_slave = pty.openpty()
    sim_serial_port = os.ttyname(pty_slave)
    ser_cfg = SerialCfg(
        "serial_cobs", serial_port=sim_serial_port, baud_rate=9600, polling_frequency=0.1
    )
    cobs_com_if = SerialCobsComIF(ser_cfg)
    cobs_com_if.initialize()
    cobs_com_if.open()

    test_data = bytes([0x01, 0x02, 0x03])
    # Will be used later and to determine how much to read.
    encoded_data = cobs.encode(test_data)

    # Data will be COBS encoded internally, with the 0 frame delimiter inserted at the start and
    # end
    print(f"Sending raw data: 0x[{test_data.hex(sep=',')}]")
    cobs_com_if.send(test_data)

    # Other side receives COBS encoded packet
    encoded_packet = os.read(sim_ser_device, len(encoded_data) + 2)
    decoded_packet = cobs.decode(encoded_packet[1:-1])
    print(f"Encoded packet received at simulated serial device: 0x[{encoded_packet.hex(sep=',')}]")
    print(f"Decoded packet: 0x[{decoded_packet.hex(sep=',')}]")

    # Now send COBS encoded data back
    data_sent_back = bytes([0x01, 0x02, 0x03])
    # 0 start marker
    cobs_encoded_data = bytearray([0])
    cobs_encoded_data.extend(encoded_data)
    # 0 end marker
    cobs_encoded_data.append(0)
    os.write(sim_ser_device, cobs_encoded_data)
    # Receiver thread might take some time
    time.sleep(0.15)

    packet_list = cobs_com_if.receive()
    print(f"Data received from simulated serial device: 0x[{packet_list[0].hex(sep=',')}]")
    cobs_com_if.close()

Output:

.. testoutput:: serial_cobs

    Sending raw data: 0x[01,02,03]
    Encoded packet received at simulated serial device: 0x[00,04,01,02,03,00]
    Decoded packet: 0x[01,02,03]
    Data received from simulated serial device: 0x[01,02,03]

This interface could of course also exchange a higher level protocol like PUS packets, but
this example was kept more simple to also show how a communication interface can also provide
a transport layer.
